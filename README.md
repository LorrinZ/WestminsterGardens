# WestminsterGardens
## Key features (Overview)
-	Meetings

-	Discussions
  
-	Useful Contacts
  
This is app was designed for residents of Westminster Gardens to provide easy knowledge about the area and more accessible information to do with the community. 
## Meetings
The meetings page has a couple functions. Admins can post new meetings that all people can see, they can choose the time, date, participants and add a small description of what this meeting goal is. The first 3 meetings are synced on the Home page. However, Admins will have to manually delete the meetings after they have taken place which I may improve upon in the future.
## Discussions
The discussions page has a couple functions: Firstly, everyone can make and comment on posts. To create a new post there is a Title and a small descriptions which people can comment on for board members to see and that would help the board see what most people want. The first 5 discussions are synced to home page. Again, once the discussion has finished and admins have noted on it the admins should delete this page, however residents can also delete posts currently that should be improved on in the future so that they can only delete their own posts.

## Useful Contacts
The Useful Contacts page or Info page is a page that should be added on that will show key contact details for new residents to reach out to if they have any questions, includes their name, job title, phone number and email. Admins will have to manually go through the code to add new people unfortunately which will hopefully be able to be changed in the future.
